Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisite
------------

A good background in undergraduate algebra such as Algebra I (18.701) and Algebra II (18.702).

Requirements
------------

Homework will be due about once every two weeks. A paper of 6-12 pages related to algebraic combinatorics is due on the last class.

Outline
-------
